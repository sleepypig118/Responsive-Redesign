                This is a homepage for a local bar in Providence.
                I chose to redesign it because I think it is too simple to provide the basic information that users need to know.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li id="obs">The usability is poor because users cannot find useful information that they care effectively and efficiently</li>
              <li id="obs">The efficiency is poor because most users need to take a long time to find userful information, such as products and activities it offers</li>
              <li id="obs">The learnability is fine because there is little needs to learn as a web page which only display a few of basic information</li>
              <li id="obs">The memorability is not good because the layout is so weird and different from other web pages that most users cannot remember it after a long time of none use</li>

              By using WebAIM WAVE, I found several errors and warnings of accessibility: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li id="obs">Most of linked images do not have alternative text. This is important when there is something wrong with image loading.</li>
              <li id="obs">The language of the document is not identified, which is not a big issue as this is mainly for local use.</li>
              <li id="obs">The page has no heading structure, which makes users confused at their first glances.</li>
              <li id="obs">No page regions or ARIA landmarks were found, which makes the page layout weird.</li>
